//js is a synchronous  -> it execute go one after thi other
//As its base JavaScript language is synchronous. Synchronous means the code runs
//  in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.
// Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

// console.log(1)
// console.log(2)
// console.log(3)
// console.log(4)
// console.log(5)

// ---------------------
//weeklyTyped -> we can change are primitive data type at any point of time

// let samarth = 100;
// console.log(samarth)

// samarth = true;
// console.log(samarth)

// ------------------------
//dynamic typed -> are those programming language in which the data type
//  of a variable is desided on the runtime only

let a = 100;
 a = true;
 a = "samarth vohra"
 a = undefined
 a = null
 a = 10000.2 //it will execute this , it is the desiding factor
